# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
The aim of this project is to clean the data provided in the Ecommerce table to the point where useful information could be gleaned. How realistic this goal is depends largely on how much
valid data is left over to be properly analyzed. Some columns with just a few non-NULL entries cannot be readily relied upon for identifying patterns.
## Process
1.
I first imported the data for the tables, starting with all_sessions.
2.
Next I entered some general queries just to take a look at how the data is structured in the tables, and how each column relates to the others.
3.
I began my QA process by checking each column for both NULL values and values that exist outside of the possible range. For example, columns that were denominated in dollars,
could not have values below 0. The queries I used can be found in QA.md
4.
After identifying some of the issues with the data I began cleaning. A mostly comprehensive list of the queries I used can be found in cleaning_data.md
5.
Once the glaring issues within the data were taken care of, I started on creating queries to answer the initial 5 questions. Those queries can be found in starting_with_questions.md
6.
I then took another look at the data in order to think of some interesting questions that the Ecommerce database could answer. These questions and their related queries are in the starting_with_data.md
